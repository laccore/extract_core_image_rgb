# Extract Core Image RGB
This is a quick and dirty ImageJ macro to extract RGB data from core images.

It crops to the middle 50% of the image (cross-section-wise, relative to the core), takes the red, green, and blue color channel values, and exports those to a csv with the same (pre-extension) name as the core image.
